# üéì Student Result Processing System ‚Äì Day 1

## üî∞ Day 1: Database Planning & Design

This repository contains the foundational database schema and ER model for the **Student Result Processing System** project.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Design a normalized relational database system to manage:
  - Student information
  - Course registration
  - Marks and grade calculation
  - GPA & CGPA computation

---

## üìã Tasks Completed

‚úÖ **1. Requirement Understanding**
- Identify core entities: Students, `Courses,Results, Grades, StudentCourses,Semester
- Attributes like: `marks`, `grades`, `exam_type`, `credit_hours`

‚úÖ **2. ER Diagram Created**
- ER model shows relationships:
  - One-to-many (Students ‚Üí Results)
  - Many-to-many (Students ‚Üî Courses via `StudentCourses`)
  - Grade table used for calculating GPA from marks

‚úÖ **3. Table Design & Schema**
- Created the following tables:
  - Students
  - Courses
  - Semester
  - StudentCourses (Enrollment)
  - Results
  - Grades
  - GPA

‚úÖ **4. Relationships**
- Primary Keys and Foreign Keys defined for referential integrity

# üéì Student Result Processing System ‚Äì Day 2

## üî∞ Day 2: Insert Data + Views

This part of the project focuses on inserting data into the database, executing JOIN-based queries, and creating reusable views to analyze student performance.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Insert sample data into all relational tables
- Use JOINs for reporting and analysis
- Create **Views** for simplified query access
- Add **advanced SQL operations** using aggregates and subqueries

---

## üìã Tasks Completed

### ‚úÖ 1. Data Insertion
All tables populated using INSERT INTO:
- Students
- Courses
- Semester
- StudentCourses
- Results
- Grades

‚úÖ All data saved in data.sql

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Queries with JOINs
Created complex SELECT queries for:

- Student-wise subject performance  
- Course-wise average, max, min marks  
- Exam-type filters (e.g., Final only)  
- GPA computation using `Grades` table  
- Listing students who failed  
- Course toppers using subqueries

‚úÖ All queries saved in queries_day2.sql

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Views Created

| View Name                 | Description                                      |

| view_course_performance   | Avg marks and attempts per course                |
| view_distinction_students | Students who scored 75+ in any subject          |

‚úÖ View scripts are also saved in `queries_day2.sql`

---

## üí° Advanced Queries Added

- üìå **Topper Selection** ‚Äì Highest scorer in each subject  
- üìå **GPA Calculation** ‚Äì Average grade point using JOIN + GROUP BY  
- üìå **Failed Students** ‚Äì Students scoring less than 40 marks  
- üìå **Final Exam Only** ‚Äì Filtering exam results by type  
- üìå **View for Distinction Students** ‚Äì Marks ‚â• 75

## üî∞ Day 3 ‚Äì Stored Procedures, GPA Calculation & Summary Views

## üéØ Objectives

- Create and execute a Stored Procedure to calculate grades based on marks.
- Use CASE statements for GPA logic.
- Generate a summary view showing student performance and GPA.
- Understand procedural SQL and modular query design.

## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed
## 1. üîÅ Stored Procedure: Calculate_Grades()
Automatically assigns grades based on the marks a student received using SQL CASE.


DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE Calculate_Grades()
BEGIN 
	UPDATE results
    SET grades = (
		CASE 
			WHEN marks_obained >=90 THEN 'A+'	
            WHEN marks_obained >=80 THEN 'A'
            WHEN marks_obained >=70 THEN 'B+'
            WHEN marks_obained >=60 THEN 'B'
			WHEN marks_obained >=50 THEN 'C'
			WHEN marks_obained >=40 THEN 'D'
			ELSE 'F'
		END
	);
END //
DELIMITER ;

‚úÖ Called using: CALL Calculate_Grades();
## 2. üìä GPA Calculation View: GPA_View
Calculates GPA per student by converting grades to grade points using SQL CASE.


CREATE VIEW GPA_View AS
SELECT 
    Student_id,
    ROUND(AVG(
        CASE grade
            WHEN 'A+' THEN 10
            WHEN 'A' THEN 9
            WHEN 'B+' THEN 8
            WHEN 'B' THEN 7
            WHEN 'C' THEN 6
            WHEN 'D' THEN 5
            ELSE 0
        END
    ), 2) AS GPA
FROM Results
GROUP BY Student_id;

‚úÖ Result: Each student‚Äôs GPA based on all subjects
## 3. üìÑ Summary View: result_summary
Displays student ID, name, and GPA by joining Students and Results:

CREATE VIEW result_summary AS
SELECT 
    s.Stud_ID,
    s.name,
    ROUND(AVG(
        CASE r.grade
            WHEN 'A+' THEN 10
            WHEN 'A' THEN 9
            WHEN 'B+' THEN 8
            WHEN 'B' THEN 7
            WHEN 'C' THEN 6
            WHEN 'D' THEN 5
            ELSE 0
        END
